# Occasion-First Filtering - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What It Does
Ensures **every item** is **occasion-appropriate** before any other processing.

---

## 🔑 Key Principle

> **Occasion is king.** Items must match the occasion **first**, then we apply style/mood/weather filters.

---

## 📊 How It Works

```
Step 1: Exact Match     →  Find items with exact occasion
Step 2: Fallbacks       →  If < 3 items, use related occasions  
Step 3: Deduplication   →  Remove duplicates by ID
```

## 🔍 Quick Example

### Gym Outfit Request:

```
Wardrobe: 100 casual + 50 business + 10 gym items

❌ OLD WAY:
  → All 160 items passed to scoring
  → Dress shoes might score high
  → Result: Inappropriate outfit

✅ NEW WAY:
  → Step 1: Only 10 gym items pass
  → Step 2: These 10 scored
  → Result: Gym-appropriate outfit
```
