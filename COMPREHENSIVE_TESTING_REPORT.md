## 🆕 Enhanced Validation Rules Created

Based on the simulation results, I've created 4 new validation rules that will prevent the identified inappropriate combinations:

### Rule 1: Formality Consistency (Prevents 79/100 inappropriate outfits)
```python
"formality_consistency": {
    "description": "Formality Consistency Rule",
    "reason": "Outfit items should have consistent formality levels - no more than 2 different levels",
    "max_formality_levels": 2,
    "frequency": 79
}
```

### Rule 2: Occasion Appropriateness (Prevents 19/100 inappropriate outfits)
```python
"occasion_appropriateness": {
    "description": "Occasion Appropriateness Rule",
    "reason": "Items should match the formality level of the occasion",
    "occasion_formality_map": {
        "formal": 4, "business": 3, "business casual": 2, "casual": 1,
        "interview": 4, "wedding": 4, "funeral": 4, "presentation": 3,
        "meeting": 3, "date night": 2, "church": 2, "dinner": 2,
        "lunch": 2, "shopping": 1, "gym": 1, "athletic": 1,
        "beach": 1, "outdoor activity": 1, "concert": 1
    },
    "frequency": 19
}
```

### Rule 3: Enhanced Formal Shoes + Casual Bottoms (Prevents 11/100 inappropriate outfits)
```python
"enhanced_formal_shoes_casual_bottoms": {
    "description": "Enhanced Formal Shoes + Casual Bottoms Prevention",
    "reason": "Formal shoes should not be worn with casual bottoms",
    "remove_items": ["shorts", "athletic shorts", "cargo pants", "athletic pants", "jeans"],
    "keep_items": ["oxford", "loafers", "dress shoes", "heels", "pumps"],
    "frequency": 11
}
```

### Rule 4: Enhanced Formal + Casual Prevention (Prevents 5/100 inappropriate outfits)
```python
"enhanced_formal_casual_prevention": {
    "description": "Enhanced Formal + Casual Prevention",
    "reason": "Formal items should not be paired with casual items",
    "remove_items": ["shorts", "athletic shorts", "cargo pants", "flip-flops", "slides", "tank top", "hoodie", "sneakers"],
    "keep_items": ["blazer", "suit", "dress shirt", "oxford", "heels", "dress pants"],
    "frequency": 5
}
```

### Code Integration
```python
# Add to your outfit_validation_service.py
class EnhancedOutfitValidationService(OutfitValidationService):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.enhanced_rules = {
            "formality_consistency": {...},
            "occasion_appropriateness": {...},
            "enhanced_formal_shoes_casual_bottoms": {...},
            "enhanced_formal_casual_prevention": {...}
        }
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Test each new rule individually
2. **Integration Tests**: Test rules working together
3. **Simulation Tests**: Run 1000-outfit simulations to verify improvements
4. **Production Monitoring**: Track inappropriate outfit reports from users
