# Railway configuration for background-processor worker service
# Service name: background-processor
# Root Directory: backend/worker (set in Railway dashboard)
# 
# This service uses NIXPACKS builder (not Dockerfile)
# NIXPACKS allows sys.path to resolve ../src at runtime, unlike Dockerfile
# which restricts build context to backend/worker only.
