# Mood-Based Scoring Implementation

## Issue
User reported that moods are not being used in outfit generation. Only "Bold" mood had any functionality (in exclusion rules), while the other 5 moods were accepted but ignored.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive mood-based scoring for all 6 moods, giving each mood distinct personality and influence on outfit selection.

## How It Works

### Scoring System
Moods influence outfit generation through a point-based system:

1. **Style scoring** runs first (based on style definitions)
2. **Occasion override** runs second (functional requirements like gym ‚Üí athletic wear)
3. **Mood adjustment** runs last (fine-tunes based on emotional vibe)

### Example Workflow:
```
User Request: Classic style + Romantic mood + Date occasion

Item: Blue silk blouse
‚îú‚îÄ Style (Classic): +15 points (button-up, collared)
‚îú‚îÄ Occasion (Date): No override
‚îî‚îÄ Mood (Romantic): +15 points (silk, elegant)
   Total: 30 points ‚úÖ HIGH SCORE

Item: Gray wool blazer  
‚îú‚îÄ Style (Classic): +30 points (blazer, tailored)
‚îú‚îÄ Occasion (Date): No override
‚îî‚îÄ Mood (Romantic): 0 points (neutral)
   Total: 30 points ‚úÖ HIGH SCORE

Item: Black cargo pants
‚îú‚îÄ Style (Classic): -25 points (inappropriate)
‚îú‚îÄ Occasion (Date): No override
‚îî‚îÄ Mood (Romantic): -10 points (cargo, utility)
   Total: -35 points ‚ùå FILTERED OUT
```

---

## Priority Order

The system follows this hierarchy:

1. **Occasion** (Highest) - Functional requirements override style/mood
   - Example: Gym occasion always requires athletic wear, even with "Sophisticated" style

2. **Style** (Medium) - Main aesthetic direction
   - Example: "Gothic" style filters for dark, black items

3. **Mood** (Lowest) - Fine-tuning within style constraints
   - Example: "Gothic + Serene" softens goth aesthetic with calmer pieces

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`backend/src/routes/outfits/styling.py`**
   - Added `mood` parameter to `calculate_style_appropriateness_score()`
   - Implemented mood-based scoring logic (lines 691-785)
   - Added keyword matching for all 6 moods

2. **`backend/src/routes/outfits/rule_engine.py`**
   - Updated scoring call to pass `mood` parameter (lines 89-94)
   - Added mood to logging context

### Scoring Logic

Each mood has:
- **Boost keywords** (+15 points): Items matching mood aesthetic get preference
- **Penalty keywords** (-8 to -10 points): Items conflicting with mood get deprioritized
- **Neutral items** (no change): Items that don't match but don't conflict

## Metrics to Monitor
