## 🚀 **HIGH PRIORITY Additions (Critical for Better Outfits):**

### **1. Transparency/Opacity Level**
**Why Critical:** Determines layering requirements and modesty considerations

**Suggested values:**
- `opaque` - Fully opaque, no layering needed
- `semi-sheer` - Slightly see-through, may need layering
- `sheer` - Very transparent, requires layering
- `textured-opaque` - Textured but not see-through (lace, mesh panels)

**Use cases:**
- ❌ Don't pair sheer top with sheer skirt (too revealing)
- ✅ Sheer top → requires camisole or bralette underneath
- ✅ Opaque items can stand alone
- Gender-neutral consideration (men's sheer shirts exist too)

**Example:** "This white cotton shirt is slightly semi-sheer and may require an undershirt in bright light"

---

### **2. Heel Height (Shoes Only)**
**Why Critical:** Affects formality, occasion appropriateness, and comfort

**Use cases:**
