# Railway Logging Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Excessive logging causing Railway rate limiting (500+ logs/second)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Code deployed, awaiting Railway configuration

---

## üîç Issues Identified

### 1. Excessive Item-by-Item Logging (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** The outfit generation service was logging every item score during outfit creation:
```
‚úÖ‚úÖ PRIMARY: Casual occasion tag match: 1.00
‚úÖ‚úÖ PRIMARY: Casual occasion tag match: 1.00
‚úÖ‚úÖ PRIMARY: Casual occasion tag match: 1.00
... (repeated 38+ times per request)
```

**Impact:**
- 500+ log messages per outfit generation request
- Hit Railway's 500 logs/second rate limit
- Increased costs and performance degradation
- Made debugging difficult due to log flooding

**Files Affected:**
- `backend/src/services/robust_outfit_generation_service.py` (lines 3008, 3241, 3244, 3334)
- Multiple `logger.info` calls in scoring loops

### 2. Debug Logs in Production
**Problem:** Debug-level logs were being output at INFO level:
- `üîç DEBUG SCORE 1:`, `DEBUG SCORE 2:`, etc.
- `üîç DEBUG PHASE 1:`, `DEBUG FINAL SELECTION:`
- Item-by-item processing logs

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Changed Logger Levels
**Changed all item-scoring logs from `logger.info` to `logger.debug`:**

```python
# BEFORE (causing 500+ logs/sec)
logger.info(f"  ‚úÖ‚úÖ PRIMARY: Casual occasion tag match: {+1.0 * occasion_multiplier:.2f}")

# AFTER (only visible when debugging)
logger.debug(f"  ‚úÖ‚úÖ PRIMARY: Casual occasion tag match: {+1.0 * occasion_multiplier:.2f}")
```

**Affected locations:**
- Occasion tag matching (4 instances)
- Item scoring debug logs (11 instances)
- Phase selection logs (6 instances)

### Fix #2: Environment-Based Logging
**Added `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable support:**

```python
# backend/app.py
LOG_LEVEL = os.getenv("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO").upper()
logging.basicConfig(level=getattr(logging, LOG_LEVEL, logging.INFO))
```

**Configuration:**
- Development: `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` (default)
- Production: `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` (recommended)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (ACTION REQUIRED)

### Set Environment Variable in Railway

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: https://railway.app
   - Select project: `closetgpt-backend`
   - Click on your backend service

2. **Add Environment Variable:**
   - Click "Variables" tab
   - Click "+ New Variable"
   - **Name:** `LOG_LEVEL`
   - **Value:** `WARNING`
   - Click "Add"

3. **Redeploy (Automatic):**
   - Railway will automatically redeploy after adding the variable
   - Wait for deployment to complete

4. **Verify Fix:**
   - Monitor Railway logs
   - Log volume should drop by ~95%
   - Should see only warnings and errors
   - No more item-by-item scoring logs

---

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
Total logs per request: 500+
Primary cause: Item scoring in tight loop
Rate limit: ‚ö†Ô∏è EXCEEDED (500/sec limit)
Performance: üî¥ DEGRADED
```

### After Fix (with LOG_LEVEL=WARNING)
```
Total logs per request: ~10-20
Primary logs: Warnings, errors, critical info
Rate limit: ‚úÖ SAFE (well under limit)
Performance: ‚úÖ IMPROVED
Cost: ‚úÖ REDUCED
```

## üß™ Testing

### How to Test Locally
```bash
# Test with WARNING level (production mode)
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING python backend/app.py

# Generate an outfit - should see minimal logs
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/outfits/generate ...

# Test with DEBUG level (verbose mode)
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python backend/app.py

# Generate an outfit - should see all debug logs
```

### How to Test in Railway
1. Set `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` in Railway
2. Generate an outfit from the frontend
3. Check Railway logs - should see:
   - ‚úÖ Service startup messages
   - ‚úÖ Request received/completed
   - ‚úÖ Any warnings or errors
   - ‚ùå NO item-by-item scoring logs
   - ‚ùå NO debug phase logs

## üìö Documentation

- **Logging Guide:** See `backend/LOGGING.md` for comprehensive documentation
- **Log Levels:** DEBUG < INFO < WARNING < ERROR < CRITICAL
- **Recommended:** Use WARNING in production, INFO in staging, DEBUG for troubleshooting

---

## üîß Additional Notes

### Temporary Debugging
If you need to see debug logs temporarily:
```bash
# In Railway, temporarily change:
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# After debugging, revert to:
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
```

### Cost Optimization
- Each log message has a cost in Railway
- Reducing log volume can significantly reduce costs
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` to optimize costs

### Log Sampling (Future Enhancement)
If WARNING level still produces too many logs, consider:
- Sampling logs (log 1 out of every N requests)
- Aggregating metrics instead of individual logs
- Using structured logging with log levels

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [x] Fixed excessive logging in code
- [x] Added environment-based configuration
- [x] Created documentation
- [x] Deployed to production
- [ ] **Set `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` in Railway** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **DO THIS NOW**
- [ ] Verify log reduction in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

---

## üìû Support

If issues persist after setting `LOG_LEVEL=WARNING`:
1. Check Railway logs for any errors
2. Verify environment variable is set correctly
3. Try `LOG_LEVEL=ERROR` for even less logging
4. Review `backend/LOGGING.md` for troubleshooting
