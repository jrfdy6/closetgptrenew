#### Browser Inspector Test:
1. Inspect the `<nav>` element
2. Look for classes: `glass-navbar`, `glass-blur-strong`
3. Verify styles:
   - `backdrop-filter: blur(40px)`
   - `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)` (light mode)
   - `position: sticky` or `fixed`

## Test 3: Sign In / Sign Up Pages

### Location: http://localhost:3000/signin

#### Visual Checklist:
- [ ] Card has floating glass effect
- [ ] Card has subtle shadow and glow
- [ ] Hover: card lifts up slightly (-1px)
- [ ] Hover: shadow intensifies
- [ ] Gradient background visible through card

#### Hover Test:

---

## Test 7: Performance Test

### FPS Test:
1. Open DevTools > Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Hover over multiple glass elements
4. Scroll page with glass navbar
5. Stop recording

#### Check Results:
- [ ] FPS should stay above 55-60fps
- [ ] No significant frame drops
- [ ] Smooth animations throughout
- [ ] GPU acceleration active (check for "Composite Layers")

---

## Test 8: Color Gradient Variants

### Location: Various pages

#### Look for themed glass:
- [ ] `glass-amber` - Amber/orange gradient glass
- [ ] `glass-stone` - Stone/gray gradient glass
- [ ] Should see subtle color tints in the glass effect

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Glass looks solid (not transparent)
**Check:** 
- Background opacity value (should be /40, /60, etc.)
- Backdrop-filter is supported by browser
- No conflicting `opacity: 1` or `background: solid` styles

### Issue: No blur visible
**Check:**
- Browser supports `backdrop-filter` (most modern browsers do)
- No browser extension blocking effects
- GPU acceleration enabled

### Issue: Dark mode not switching
**Check:**
- Dark class applied to `<html>` or `<body>` element
- Tailwind dark mode configured correctly
- Theme toggle button functional

### Issue: Hover effects not working
**Check:**
- Element has hover classes (hover:scale-[1.02], etc.)
- Transitions defined (transition-all duration-300)
- CSS not overridden by other styles

## üì∏ Screenshot Reference Points

Take screenshots at these key moments:

1. **Landing page hero** (light mode)
2. **Landing page hero** (dark mode)
3. **Navigation bar with content scrolled under it**
4. **Sign-in card on hover**
5. **Dashboard with multiple glass cards**
6. **Mobile menu open** (responsive)
7. **Browser inspector showing backdrop-filter**

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your glass implementation is working correctly if:

‚úÖ All elements with glass classes show frosted/blurred backgrounds  
‚úÖ Content behind glass is blurred and visible  
‚úÖ Borders are semi-transparent  
‚úÖ Shadows render with subtle opacity  
‚úÖ Hover states trigger smooth animations  
‚úÖ Dark mode switches all glass effects correctly  
‚úÖ Mobile menu has strong blur effect  
‚úÖ Performance stays at 60fps  
‚úÖ Works across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox

## üêõ Reporting Issues

If you find issues, document:
1. Which page/component
2. Which class (glass-card, glass-navbar, etc.)
3. Screenshot showing the problem
4. Browser & version
5. Console errors (if any)
