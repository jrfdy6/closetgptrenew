# Flat Lay as Hero Image - Implementation Update

## 🎯 Changes Made

The flat lay image is now displayed as the **PRIMARY/HERO IMAGE** of outfits, making it the largest and most prominent visual element.

---

## ✅ What Changed

### 1. **Outfit Results Display** (Generation Page)
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ui/outfit-results-display.tsx`

**Before**: Flat lay was shown as a separate section with a heading
**After**: Flat lay is the HERO image at the top

**Changes:**
- ✅ Flat lay now spans full width at the top (edge-to-edge with `-mx-6`)
- ✅ Removed "Flat Lay View" heading - it's now self-evident
- ✅ Flat lay appears BEFORE the item grid
- ✅ Fallback: If no flat lay, shows first item as hero image
- ✅ Item grid relabeled to "Outfit Details" (secondary information)

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
1. Outfit Name & Badges (header)
2. FLAT LAY IMAGE ⭐ (HERO - largest, most prominent)
3. Outfit Details Grid (secondary, smaller items)
4. Actions & Rating
```

### 2. **Outfit Cards** (List/Grid View)
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ui/enhanced-outfit-card.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `metadata.flat_lay_url` to Outfit interface
- ✅ Flat lay shown as main preview in outfit cards
- ✅ Full aspect ratio (9:16) display instead of square grid
- ✅ Badge shows "Flat Lay View" for clarity
- ✅ Clickable to view outfit details
- ✅ Fallback: Shows 2x2 item grid if no flat lay

**Visual Update:**
```
Before: 2x2 grid of 4 items (square)
After:  Full flat lay image (9:16 portrait) OR 2x2 grid fallback
```

### Size Comparison
- **Flat Lay**: Full width, 9:16 aspect ratio (~1080x1920 display area)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Automatic Behavior
1. **✅ YES**: Flat lay is automatically added by backend

### Fallback Strategy
```typescript
if (outfit.metadata?.flat_lay_url) {
  // Show flat lay as hero
  <FlatLayViewer ... />
} else if (outfit.items[0]?.imageUrl) {
  // Show first item as hero
  <img src={outfit.items[0].imageUrl} />
} else {
  // Show item grid
  <ItemGrid ... />
}
```
