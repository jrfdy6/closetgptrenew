## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Flat Lay Not Showing?

**Check These:**
1. ✅ Does your outfit have at least 2 items?
2. ✅ Do your items have valid image URLs?
3. ✅ Are the images accessible (not placeholder images)?

**If Still Not Working:**
- The system gracefully falls back to grid view
- You can still see all your items individually
- Try regenerating the outfit

### Images Look Wrong?

**Common Issues:**
- **Items Too Large**: Some items may appear oversized - this is a known limitation
- **Background Visible**: Light backgrounds work best; dark backgrounds may show through
- **Positioning Off**: Layout is optimized for standard clothing items
