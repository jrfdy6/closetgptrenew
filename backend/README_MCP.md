## 🚀 Deployment to Railway

### Create New Railway Service

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Choose your `closetgptrenew` repository**
5. **Name:** `ClosetGPT MCP Server`

### Configure Service

**Root Directory:** `/backend`

**Start Command:** 
```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
MAIN_API_URL=https://closetgptrenew-production.railway.app
API_KEY=<generate-your-secret-key>
PORT=3002
```

### Generate API Key

```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print('API_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

## 🔧 What Happens After Deployment

1. **Railway builds your MCP server**
2. **Gives you a URL:** `https://closetgpt-mcp-xxxxx.railway.app`
3. **MCP server is accessible via HTTP**
4. **Ready to connect to ChatGPT**

---

## 📝 Testing Locally (Alternative)

If you want to test the tools locally without Inspector:

```bash
cd backend
source venv_mcp/bin/activate
export MAIN_API_URL=https://closetgptrenew-production.railway.app
export API_KEY=test-key
python3 test_mcp_simple.py
```

This shows all tools and tests basic functionality.

## 🎉 Why Inspector is Confusing

The Apps SDK documentation shows MCP Inspector, but the actual Apps SDK uses a different integration path:

**Apps SDK Integration:**
1. Deploy your MCP server (gets HTTP URL)
2. Register URL in OpenAI Apps SDK platform
3. OpenAI handles the connection
4. Test directly in ChatGPT interface

You **don't need** MCP Inspector for Apps SDK deployment!

---

## ✅ You're Ready!

**Next Step:** Deploy to Railway!

The Inspector is optional for testing. Your server is ready for production deployment and ChatGPT integration.
