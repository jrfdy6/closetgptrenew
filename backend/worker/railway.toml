# Railway configuration for background-processor worker service
# This service uses NIXPACKS builder (not Dockerfile)
# Root Directory: backend/worker (cannot be changed)
# Start Command: python main.py
# 
# NIXPACKS allows sys.path to resolve ../src at runtime, unlike Dockerfile
# which restricts build context to backend/worker only.
