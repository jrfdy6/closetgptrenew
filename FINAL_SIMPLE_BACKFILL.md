### **Step 1: Open Terminal**
Open Terminal on your Mac (or use the one in VS Code/Cursor)

  2. DRY RUN (test all items, no changes)
  3. PRODUCTION (actually update database)

Enter choice (1-3): 1

🔍 Mode: DRY RUN with 10 items
============================================================

🔍 [1] DRY RUN: Would update item_001
🔍 [2] DRY RUN: Would update item_002

...

📊 RESULTS:
   Processed: 10

## 🎯 Quick Steps (TL;DR)

```bash
cd /Users/johnniefields/Desktop/Cursor/closetgptrenew
source backend/venv/bin/activate
python3 LOCAL_BACKFILL_SCRIPT.py
# Then type: 1 (for test), 2 (for full test), or 3 (for production)
```

---

## ✅ What Happens Next

### After Testing (Option 1 or 2):
- You'll see what would be updated
- No database changes are made
- You can verify everything looks good

### After Production Run (Option 3):
- All wardrobe items get `normalized` field added
- Original data stays untouched
- Semantic filtering will work automatically

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Service account key not found"
Make sure `backend/service-account-key.json` exists

### "Firebase initialization failed"
The service account key might be expired or invalid

### "Authentication errors"
This is normal warning - the script will still work
